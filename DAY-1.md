# Tech Interview Basics

So, what happens in a technical interview? Every company is different, but let‚Äôs take a look at the average situations you might face.

## Stages of the technical interview

Often, tech interviews will come in three basic stages:

**üìû 1st stage: the technical phone or video screen.** Good news! The company liked your resume and wants to talk to you more. This short social & technical screening stage is designed to see if you are qualified and enthusiastic enough to proceed to the next technical round. This interview stage typically lasts 15-30 minutes.

**üìù 2nd stage: remote coding interview/assignment.** Some companies will want to test your coding skills with a preliminary test before having you actually come in. It may be conducted over the phone, via Skype or Zoom, or could be a homework-type assignment. If the company is respectful of your time, a remote coding challenge should only take a few hours.

**üíª 3rd and final stage: onsite interview/whiteboarding challenge.** This is the stage that most people call the actual ‚Äútechnical interview.‚Äù It involves an in-person interview with coding challenges you have to complete on a whiteboard in front of the interviewer(s). This could also be done remotely over video conference if the company is remote. Whiteboard interviews typically last 1-2 hours, but the whole onsite technical interview can be several hours to a full day.

# What to Expect When You‚Äôre Interviewing

Let‚Äôs break down each stage of the typical technical interview process, with quick tech interview tips for how to pass a technical interview and stand out in each part.

## During the phone technical phone interview

Here are a few more tips on how to prepare for a technical phone interview:

- Be excited about the company or project, and that positivity will come across in the interview.

- Know your audience. If you‚Äôre interviewing with a recruiter (with no programming knowledge), play up your soft skills and don‚Äôt get too technical. If you‚Äôre interviewing with a software developer, show off that tech knowledge!
- Be honest: tell the interviewer what most interests you in a job and what kinds of projects you‚Äôd like to work on.
- Answer behavioral questions by showing, not telling. Use specific, memorable details and tell a story.

## What interviewers are looking for in the phone interview

Beyond just pure tech skills, which they‚Äôve already read about on your resume, interviewers in a phone screen want to see:

üë©‚Äçüíª Passion for tech/coding

üòÑ Enthusiasm

üó£Ô∏è Communication skills

ü§ó Culture fit

ü§ù Alignment with company mission/values

## How to stand out over the phone

Even if you‚Äôve applied to hundreds of jobs, tailor your answers to the exact one you‚Äôre interviewing for. ‚ÄúWhen a candidate answers the interview questions in a way that is specific to the company and the position, it shows that they have done their research,‚Äù

Also, look for opportunities to show your value alignment. When you make it clear that you support the big picture and the mission of the organization, it‚Äôs a great sign that you will be a good fit,‚Äù

## Remote Coding Challenge

This technical round has some flexibility in how companies handle it. So first, let‚Äôs go over some of the common types of remote programming interview questions or challenges.

- Some companies will give you a real-time monitored challenge to see how you code. Often this is done via a video interview + a web-based code editor like CoderPad, Collabedit, or even a Google Doc.
- Other companies (usually startups) may simply require you to complete an at-home assignment instead within a set time limit‚Äìusually 48 hours.
- Really small startups may not include a remote coding challenge at all‚Äìinstead bringing you in for an onsite interview immediately after the phone interview‚Äìbut bigger companies often do. (General rule: the bigger the company, the more structured the hiring process is.)

## coding interview preparation tips for the remote coding challenge

During a real-time coding challenge, communicate with your interviewer and think out loud. Make it a collaborative process (use ‚Äúwe‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI‚Äù), since interviewers want to know that you‚Äôre a team player. And remember to slow down. These real-time challenges are not usually timed, so take your time, think it through, and give the interviewer a chance to give you hints.

During a take-home coding assignment, take time to plan out your code before writing it out. Make sure you fully understand the instructions and requirements. Re-read them several times before starting and once more after you‚Äôre finished with the challenge to make sure you‚Äôve ticked every box.

## What interviewers are looking for in the coding challenge

- Coding skills
- Testing code as you write it
- Problem-solving skills
  -Collaboration skills

## How to stand out in a remote coding challenge

One way to stand out in your remote coding challenge technical round is to go above and beyond. Sometimes remote coding challenges will come with optional ‚Äúbonus‚Äù requirements. Complete those requirements to impress your interviewers.

## Onsite interview and Whiteboard challenge

I must say this is the most intimidating part of the entire tech interview process. But i will share more on how to prepare for your technical interview further down

## What to do during the onsite technical interview

1. Ask clarifying questions before you even start writing code.

   Instead of starting to write out your code immediately, slow down. Even if you think you already know how to solve the problem or answer the question, ask clarifying questions. By doing this, you might get hints from the interviewer, plus you want to make sure you fully understand the challenge/question before diving in.

2. Talk through your code (think out loud) to give the interviewer a window into your thoughts.

   What happens in a technical interview is as much about the journey as the destination. It‚Äôs designed to test a candidate‚Äôs communication and problem-solving skills. More important than the solution is how you work at getting the solution. Can you articulate your thoughts while writing out the code on the whiteboard? Are you putting together a clear response to the question?

3. Speak clearly and precisely.

   Being in a high-pressure situation like a programming interview might have you a little flustered, but work through it. Being as clear and specific as possible can help you keep yourself collected.

4. If you‚Äôre stuck, stay calm, think out loud, and try new ideas

   Not sure of the answer to some coding interview questions? Start with what you do know. Coding interviews are a lot like math exams in high school and university: often, you‚Äôll get ‚Äòpartial credit‚Äô for showing your work and putting in some effort to find a solution. If you can demonstrate your thought process, the interviewer will understand that you‚Äôre doing your best to find a solution.

   How to pass a technical interview isn‚Äôt always about getting everything 100% right, but staying cool and rational under pressure will always help!

5. Check for errors & walk through your solution at the end

   Companies want to hire software engineers who can write bug-free code, or at least know how to check for errors. Towards the end of writing out your solution, begin to check for any errors. This can show interviewers that you‚Äôre not just interested in writing code, but that you want to write good code.
